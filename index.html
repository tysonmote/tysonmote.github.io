  <p><strong>Tyson Mote</strong> is a Principal Engineer at <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>. He was born in Montana and he raised and <a href="https://eldoradocountyfair.org/livestock.html">sold pigs at the county fair</a> to buy his <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ibook/specs/ibook_se.html">first computer</a>, but he’s more of a city person these days. He lives in Portland, Oregon and has a wife and son that he likes very, very much.</p>

  <p>He’d like to visit Iceland someday; it sounds nice.</p>

  <p>You can email him at <a href="mailto:tyson@bufio.net">tyson@bufio.net</a>.</p>
